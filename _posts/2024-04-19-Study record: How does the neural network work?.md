# Study record: How does the neural network work?

In Kaggle's tutorial "How to Understand How Neural Networks Really Work," Jeremy Howard details the basic components and workings of neural networks.  
Starting with a simple definition of neural networks, the paper explains how networks make predictions by learning patterns in input data. 
The concepts of forward propagation and back propagation, as well as the role of loss functions and the importance of optimization algorithms such as gradient descent in network training are emphasized. 
In addition, Howard uses code examples to show how these concepts work in practice, helping the reader to more intuitively understand how neural networks work.
